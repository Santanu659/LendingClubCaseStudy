- Data UnderStanding
- Data Cleaning
- Data Analysis 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
## Data Visualisation
- For visualising the data for which most of the default cases has been arised, we have segregated the sorted columns in to two parts i.e. Categorical Columns and Numerical Columns.
- We have seperately done univariate analysis for each of the categorical and numerical 	 columns. 
- The loan_amnt histogram shows a positively skewed nature.
- From the Annual income histplot it has been cleared that the most default cases are of applicants with lower annual income.

## Conclusions
- Most default cases are for loan amount less than 25000 and 50 percentile defaulter have taken loan of less than 10000 i.e these applicants are of financially weaker section hence canâ€™t able to repay this amount.
- From the income plot also it is clear that the maximum defaulters having anual income<1 lakh rupee.
- Max default cases has been arised when comparatively high loan has been taken for short term i.e. 36 months
- The most default cases are from group A,B,C,D and E. Among which B3,B4,B5,C1 and C2 have the maximum default. 
- The applicants who are living in a rent house or in mortage are failing to repay the loan.
- Maximum defaulters are generated due to failing in verifcation of applicant data.
- Applicants who are taking loan to repay their debt are mostly failing to repay the loan.
